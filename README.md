Ruby (Cart / Checkout Logic):

1. redemption_script.rb - Tasdhis script is to be used for cart_fixed_amount redemptions OR free_product redemptions. Implement this in the Shopify script editor.
2. sample-tier-based-discount-script.rb - Script to implement conditional discount based on VIP tier status and Shopify product tag.
3. shipping-script.rb - Script to implement tier based shipping discount.
4. min_cart_amount_coupon_restriction.rb - Use this script to restrict coupons to a minimum cart amount in Shopify.
5. redemption_script_with_product.rb - This script is to be used for stores that have both cart_fixed_amount redemptions AND free_product redemptions. Implement this in the Shopify script editor.
6. multiple-cart-free-shipping.rb - This script is only to be used with customers that have the checkout option to deliver to multiple addresses, which is enabled by the 3rd party shipping provider Giftship. The customer must first create a free shipping option with that must contain the word "free". The option will then display when the user is in the correct VIP tier. NOTE: as of Nov. 2021 there is a known issue with giftship and Shopify's preview where the script will not properly run in any preview mode. In order to do final testing, it must be published live. See the account "Happy Box" for reference.
